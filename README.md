# Chicago-Crime-Exploratory-Analysis
This is an exploratory project focused on data provided by the Chicago Police Department on crime using pandas and matplotlib. My project is focused on exploring data from the last 5 years (2020-2024). Five goals of this project are to : 
document the most common type of crime,
explore the correlation of crime to time and month,
report on the frequency of dangerous crime,
explore homicide, and
identifying Crime Frequency of Chicago neighborhoods using Aldermanic Ward data,
This project is beneficial as it provides insight into current crime trends in the city of Chicago. 
Due to the size of the data, the file could not be uploaded. Access to the data is here https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2025/t7ek-mgzi/about_data
