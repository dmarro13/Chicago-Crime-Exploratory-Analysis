# Chicago-Crime-Exploratory-Analysis
This is an exploratory project focused on the data provided by the Chicago Police Department on crime. My project is focused on exploring data from the last 5 years (2020-2024). Five goals of this project are to : 
Document the most common type of crime
Explore the correlation of crime to time and month
Report on the frequency of dangerous crime
Explore homicide
Identifying Crime Frequency of Chicago neighborhoods using Aldermanic Ward data
This project is beneficial as it provides insight into current crime trends in the city of Chicago. 
Due to the size of the data, the file could not be uploaded. Access to the data is here https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2025/t7ek-mgzi/about_data
